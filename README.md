# Welcome to My Website

This website serves as a platform for me to showcase my projects and my journey to become a developer.

I am passionate about creating efficient and user-friendly web applications, and I have been continuously learning and experimenting with different technologies for the past year. I have experience working with a variety of programming languages including TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Java, HTML, and CSS.

You can find my portfolio of projects on the "Projects" page. These projects range from simple web pages to more complex web applications. They are all built using the skills and technologies that I have learned on my journey to become a developer.

I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills. I believe that continuous learning is the key to success in the field of technology. I am excited to take on new challenges and to continue growing as a developer.
